# How to create an avatar

 2. Create a new 3D Project.
 3. [Download the SDK](https://github.com/dresklaw/ValheimPlayerModels/releases/latest/download/ValheimPlayerModels_SDK.unitypackage)
 4. Import the SDK and all your avatar assets.
 5. Change your avatar model rig to Humanoid if its not already setup from the import.
 6. Place your avatar model in the scene.
 7. Add a "Valheim Avatar Descriptor" component on your avatar.
 8. Click the "Auto-Setup" Button.
 9. Move the different equipment previews to fit your hands and the armour previews to fit your character.
 10. Change your avatar material shaders to "Valheim/Standard" or "Standard". Other shaders may have strange effects in-game.
 11. Click the "Export" button in the Avatar Descriptor.
 12. Export in the "PlayerModels" folder in your game install folder.
